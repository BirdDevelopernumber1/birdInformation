				<h2 id="irg">Indian Ring necks.</h2>
		    	<p>Another famous breed of birds is a Indian Ring neck! Their name comes from their appearance. On their neck they have a black ring which appeals their appearance very well. They can surely talk as well! Their lifespan is more than 30 years! It's surely crazy, right? </p>

		    	<h2 id="crows">Crows</h2>
	    		<p> Crows are certainly impressive. They speak surprisingly clear just like a human! Just watch out, they might eat your garden or maybe steal your shining jewerly! They usually locate in several farm lands, towns and cities! They take advantage of most of their current food and new food as well! They usually lay 4-6 and sometimes 3-9 eggs. The eggs are a sort of blue/gray/green color. About 4-5 weeks after hatching, the young crows, (also called chicks) leave their nest. As mentioned, these birds are lovers to eat. Whatever they find wether it be some cloth, insects, crops or concrete they will always willingly peck it. </p>

			    <h2> Caption </h2>
			    <p> Scarlett Macaws are very special and smart! In this image two birds are shown, specifically Scarlett Macaws, and they are very close to one another. That is because this breed of birds is very similar to a human. Their lifespan is about 80 years. When Scarlett Macaws find themselves a significant other, their relationship is very similar to a humans. When they get mad at eachother for a certain act they will seperate from eachother and that seperation can go on for about two months! Their feelings and emotions are extremely similar to a human being. Adding on, Scarlett Macaws can indeed outlive you. </p>

		   		<h2 id="budgies"> Budgies </h2>
		   		<p> Budgies are very small parrots which makes them very suitable for most! They come in lots of colors, they can be albino, yellow, green, blue and more! Even though they're small, male budgies can be taught to talk maybe not as clearly but they can most definitly if taught well. They don't need any specific attention although it is good to let them out a good two hours a day to play around because again birds are unique, most parrots are like humans and when not given the undivided attention they need they can fall into depression and unfortunately pass away. They are very loyal to their owners/mates.</p>

		   		<h2 id="cockatoo">Cockatoo</h2>
	    		<p> Here comes one of our amazing dancers! These parrots are lovers to dance to some music and maybe sing along which makes them very loud. They're also known as the umbrella cockatoos because whenever they begin to dance the feathers on the top of their head raise like a umbrella! They are usually known to group up in the wild. Differentially, these birds don't really bond with eachother. Of course they mate and so on but unfortunately, they don't always establish serious bonds.</p>
